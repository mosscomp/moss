`moss` is a vertically-integrated computer with the following design goals:

- Exceedingly understandable by users.
- Competitive in performance.

These two goals are frequently at odds in computer architecture as performance
often necessitates complexity. However, compromising one for the other results
in either users understanding a computer that is not a realistic representation
of a modern day machine, or the computer being far too complex for a user to
ever hope to understand. 

`moss` takes a logical approach to solving this problem: instead of attempting
to _eliminate_ complexity, it provides tooling to _navigate_ complexity.
